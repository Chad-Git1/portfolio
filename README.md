## Tic Tac Toe Assignment 2
Has the game we decided to implement for the second assignment. We chose the Tic Tac Toe game and we have also decided to take it one step further and implement 2 different difficulties. There is "Dumb AI" an "Smart AI" difficulties.

The dumb ai simply places an "O" randomly on the board without really analysing or checking anything.

The smart ai on the other hand first checks if there's any moves that could make it win. If there is, it puts an "O" there. If not, it checks if there's any next move the user could make that would give it a win. If there is, it puts an "O" there. Else, it just reverts to placing an "O" in a random position on the board.

This way, there's 2 different difficulties for users to choose.
